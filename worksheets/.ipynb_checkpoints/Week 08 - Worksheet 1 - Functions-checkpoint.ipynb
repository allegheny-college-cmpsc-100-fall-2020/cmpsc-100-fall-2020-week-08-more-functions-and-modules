    "Just like last week, we often come upon some requirement for functionality which necessitates creating a function. Perhaps we want to organize our code. Maybe we're looking at doing something many, many times and only want to write the procedure for a _very specific_ operation once. In any event, functions will become part of our regular vocabulary from here to the end of this course (and likely your entire career in Python).\n",

    "I'll propose a problem perfect for a functional solution, one that you might have come across in your digital life: resizing pictures. But -- not just _any_ pictures: we're going to resize some very interesting vintage computer ads.\n",

    "All 2D pictures have two dimensions: width and height. To properly resize an image, getting these dimensions right requires a bit of math -- but, no fear, like the last worksheet, we're going to do this all together. In the end, we should have a nice collage. Well, at least _a_ collage.\n",
